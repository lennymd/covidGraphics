  <p>Thank you very much for using our data to improve public health during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collection for the Observatory is a purely voluntary effort and does not include financial support from the institutions involved. We are in danger of halting data collection without external resources because our partners cannot maintain an unfunded effort. Please consider donating to our project through the “Donate” button on the homepage if you find our data useful. Thank you and best wishes</p>
